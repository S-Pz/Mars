Then I watched fighting cowboys video explaining exactly what it is, and the mechanics and he read the interview with the director and I'm interested, but not as much as I would've been if it were a second expansion.

I have no Idea, but as an experiment it shows tendencies that have a bad record in recent gaming history and it has a slight \"Metal Gear Survive\" aftertaste to me. \n\nI'm waiting to see more, but I will not put any trust into this product until it's out there and I can have enough info to be sure it isn't as cynical as it seems to be.",

What would really help make this clear to players and managing expectations is if they forego the whole special ultra edition song and dance, and put the price tag at 40 to 50 bucks.\n\nThough frankly, we'll buy it either way, and nobody is going to be too hung up over it being not as great as Elden Ring, at least as long as it's still fun to play.

Seeing this is a new game and not an expansion makes me think it\u2019s going the way of every other franchise.  Weaker and weaker campaigns that support an ever expanding multiplayer game.  \n\nThat\u2019s my fear, and so it\u2019s my expectation since I\u2019d rather be surprised and really happy to be wrong and get an even better version of Elden Ring.  I preordered the DLC (I know, it\u2019s wrong to pre-order), I probably won\u2019t pre-order this unless there\u2019s serious evidence of a single player campaign that\u2019s as good as the original.",

Is this the type of thing you'd want the Elden Ring IP used for, or even the type of thing you'd want out of From Software? \n\nMost people would probably say no, and that would be a perfectly fine, understandable reaction.\n\nI also think a lot of people are worried that Elden Ring is so successful that new worlds from From Software are going to become rarer. Which is also a fair enough concern.\n\nMe personally, I think it feels like a cash grab. I'm not sure why this needed to be a new game instead of a DLC/ expansion, and I've no idea why they've suddenly pivoted into a co-op focused roguelike experience when there's nothing like that in Elden Ring or any other From Software game.\n\nBut, and this is important, From Software don't really make bad things. So I'm sure this will be good too. It's just of very little interest to me, and I'm sure other people too.\n\nEDIT: Also, to point out the obvious, the online functions of From Software's games are barely functional. It's easily the worst parts of their games, even if the concept of invasions and arena PvP are good. I'm not convinced they can suddenly change that track record here.",

Probably one of the best DLCs ever made, but nonetheless\n\nA lot of people didn\u2019t play Astrobot because it\u2019s \u201cchildish\u201d (which is ridiculous), and give it hate for no reason.",

They are for the bullying of kids for there identity.\n\nKirk Cousins said that no one is perfect when asked about having a gay teammate. Imagine you said that about having a Christian or catholic teammate or substitute what ever you need to get the point.\n\nThere is no way to politely or respectfully be agianst someone\u2019s identity.\n\nHe\u2019s for the bullying of students for who they are and views being gay as being lesser.
